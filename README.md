Interested in understanding the sun's trajectory and its potential for solar energy in your area with a simple image upload? Welcome to Aither, where we're redefining the boundaries of image processing and solar energy visualisation.

Our groundbreaking technology merges image technology with artificial intelligence to bring you profound insights into the solar energy potential of your area. We've developed a unique, manual process to create interactive solar diagrams from conventional images. Now, we're taking it one step further by introducing AI algorithms designed to automate and enhance this process.

Using your uploaded image and real data on the sun's path, our algorithms transform this information into an interactive, photographically authentic solar diagram. This allows you to visualise and calculate the solar energy potential right where you are.
